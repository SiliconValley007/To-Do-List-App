# To-Do-List-App
A GUI To-Do list application made purely in python using python dictionaries and python file handling. Is is a simple program made using the built in libraries Tkinter and OS in which you can add new tasks, delete old tasks and mark a task complete or incomplete. To make the tasks persistent we save the tasks to a txt file named 'tasks.txt'.
